# apme-sync

opto-sync/syncer.rs JSON reconciliation gateway for Apostille Me.

**Product:** Apostille Me — Case operations for visa and apostille consulting.

Track sanitized client references, document workflows, destination jurisdictions, appointments, deadlines, and case events for a visa and apostille consulting firm.

## Safety and production boundary

This software is an operational starter and does not provide legal advice. Keep identity documents and sensitive case files out of logs and this bootstrap data model; production use requires encryption, access controls, retention rules, auditability, and jurisdiction-specific professional review.

This repository is an executable bootstrap, not a production deployment. Before live
use, add authentication, tenant authorization, rate limits, durable migrations,
observability, backups, incident response, dependency review, and secret management.
## Reconciliation contract

`POST /api/v1/reconcile` accepts `{"base":...,"incoming":...}` and delegates to
`opto-sync/syncer.rs` at immutable commit `132a97c77867128656070be85d3046b0cc065cbf`. The default policy is
identity-keyed array merge using `id` plus last-writer-wins selectors
`updated_at,synced_at`.

The gateway is not a durable record by itself. Persist and authorize the result in
the owning API/database transaction, enforce idempotency, and retain conflict audit
metadata.

## Environment secrets

Secrets live in this repo **encrypted** with [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) + [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age):
`env/enc/<dev|prod>.env.enc` is committed; `just env-use <name>` decrypts it to
`env/dec/<name>.env` (gitignored, mode 0600) and symlinks `./.env` to it. The
Nix dev shell provides the tooling, `just env-audit` runs keyless in CI, and
containers decrypt at `docker run` — never at build. See [`env/README.md`](env/README.md).
